# Collin College Robotics Club Documentation Website

This website is used to host the documentation for our projects as a way to easily and efficiently share information
between all members of our team, as well as to show new members what types of projects we've done in the past, and/or to
catch them up on what we're currently working on! If you want to join us, feel free to head to CougarConnect.
