#ideas presented




Mechanical:


Having a claw with 3 prongs that allow for stability while picking up.
Having a scissor lift with hooks that allow us to hang from the bar.
Same thing but with a linear slide instead of scissor lift.
Having a wheel to spin allows us to change rpms.
Having non-slip cabinet and drawer lines for grip and stability.
Arm to allow for upward and forward movement.
Having a linear slide where the arm moves up and down ONLY.
Cage the electrical components to one side of the robot (preferably in the back).


Electrical:




Software:
Putting the PVC-Pipe in the corner allows for very consistent pick up specifically during autonomous.
Flipping the code in case we are either blue or red.
Making sure to account for the degradation of motors during the match.








Strategies:
Putting the Pvc-Pipe up and facing in the corner.
Picking up the Pvc-Pipe from the inside allows us to pinch the Pvc-Pipe when moving up or down.
For autonomous NOT filling up the batteries in the first spot, and leaving it during game time.
