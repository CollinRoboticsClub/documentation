0. Y'all did wonderful jobs at STORM!!!
	- yay!
	- Too many things had to come together for that to happen...

1. SHOULD we do STORM again..?
	- Pres. Alex: Wants fully available and committed officers.
		- "Competition Officer" + dedicated subteam
		- Subteam officers too! (Electrical, Mech, Software, etc)
		- Club itineraries -- Possibly a non-technical person!!
		- Monthly-ish officer meetings
	- **We should conduct a poll on Discord to see interest to do STORM again!**
    	- Right now it looks like just Jennifer and Yaxin...

2. What if we hosted a competition‚ÅâÔ∏è
	- Virtual attendance..?
	- Get UTD and advertise to people
	- Open to all ages and community, not just universities and colleges

3. Battlebots..?
    - Think about parts!


-- Shark tank..? --



4. Get a SAFAC order made and submitted (if possible) by the 25th
	- arian wut do u want
	- Too many parts are from Home Depot, Alex, Josh, Arian... STOP IT!!!
	- (The freaking 1/4in shafts...)
	- VEX list as well if we want to use the VEX build system
	- FTC build system perhaps?
	- Or consider RAW

5. Return To Projects! Woohoo!
   1. GPTars-like
   2. Something with the Go AI robot dog we have - Play fetch! (as per Nat) - and tiktok dances
   3. Virtual meeting attendace -- iPad on a stick on wheels
      1. "telepresence"
      2. Also you can integrate the LLM from the "GPTars-like robot" on this! Whenever it's not doing virtual attendance.
      3. + Discord bot üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
   4. Camera slider
      1. Complexity: quite simple, but I'm most confident we can do it.
   5. Roomba that picks up magnetic items
   6. Cooking
Technologies we want to try:
   - LIDAR
   - CV: Face recog
   - LLMs chatting with STT + TTS
   - ev3dev

Discord: make a channel for documentation, perhaps a discord boty that can upload to notes
