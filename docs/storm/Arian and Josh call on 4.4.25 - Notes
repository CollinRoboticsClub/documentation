# Arian and Josh call on 4/24/25 - Notes
This might serve as a TODO for 4/25/25's meeting.

## Team-wide infos
### Shark tanking
- Explain to team!
- Should help with developing ideas and getting people attached to them (we hope)

### SAFAC: We need to make a way for people to submit part requests
- a channel in the server?
    - Discord bot?
- or perhaps a Google Form
    - (josh: *i like this, a discord bot is overcomplicated lol. plus a Google Form will leave you with a good spreadsheet that you can then "version freeze" (by duplicating it or something) and send to SAFAC!*)

### Robot dog (the broken one)
- Fix with a Wago?!
- Possibly a great "intermediate" option for programmers to explore

### STORM Report - Retroactive
- [See: STORM Discord: #general](https://discord.com/channels/1148338279528276008/1148339918964277429/1362136348211024163) (sorry if these discord links don't work...)
- We could possibly put it in our docsite and then send it to them to host online?
- This would help future teams! *including ourselves!*

### Discuss build systems for purchasing!
- FTC perhaps - gobilda? rev?
    - [See: Josh yap in #mechanical-engineering](https://discord.com/channels/990425274652958751/1067505166665916467/1360495179139645480)
- Depending on plans, we may elect to not get one until later for STORM 2026..?
    - Eh. Lots of our bots can *more likely than not* be built out of FTC-*sized* components? so i think it's a worthy buy?
- More control system components perhaps... idk
    - SPARKMini motor controller? Picos? Good ways of integrating batteries into the robot overall?
        - Also upgrading our systems to the 3S LiPos that we actually own lol (instead of josh's many 2S ones)

## Build ideas:
### iPad-on-a-stick: 1 robot, 2 software versions
1. Telepresence robot
    - Could be a Discord bot that is controlled from home..?
2. GPTars-style robot
    - Great for demos, especially with Student Engagement Fairs and such!
    - LLM Integration with motors and sensors (as opposed to just live audio conversation)

### Stuff for Conner
1. a camera slider
    - this would be very Doable!! and might be a good beginnery thing to do!
    - however, it'd also probably be slightly uninteresting compared to other bots lol :)
    - He also mentioned a *dolly slider*
2. a freaking cobot™️
    - (though i'm feeling that that would be best served by a well-developed commercial product for it to be *useful* and not just a hunk of metal)
